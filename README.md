# Poker_Face
A simplified browser poker game.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps in order to get a copy of a game to run on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

This application requires [Node] to run the server. I recommend installing it with [Homebrew].

### Installation

Clone or download the project onto your local machine.

Install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
Start the server
```
npm start
```
Now you are ready to play a simplified poker game! 

Open your browser and go to `localhost:4444` and the app will launch. 

## Testing

In order to test the application, you will need to manually overwrite 'babel-core' to '@Babel/core' in the node_modules directory, mentioned in an error. 

I am currently working to solve this issue. 

Run the tests with
```
npm run test
```
